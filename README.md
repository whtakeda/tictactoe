#Tic-Tac-Toe

http://whtakeda.github.io/tictactoe

This is the first "mini-project" I did for class.  It's not quite a full-fledged project, but it came out pretty well.

You can play traditional tic-tac-toe, or 4x4 or 5x5.  You can play head-to-head with another player or versus the computer.

##Known bugs
Sometimes the Reset button doesn't reset the game properly
